Community Composting
📖 Overview

Community Composting is a digital platform designed to promote sustainable waste management by connecting households, institutions, and organizations with composters. Many individuals struggle to dispose of organic waste responsibly, while composters need a structured way to collect and process it.
This project bridges the gap by allowing users to contribute their surplus organic waste (such as food scraps, garden waste, and biodegradable materials) and enabling composters or NGOs to manage, collect, and convert it into compost effectively.

🎯 Objectives

Provide a user-friendly web platform for registering and managing organic waste contributions.

Enable composters/NGOs to track, collect, and process community contributions.

Promote eco-friendly practices and reduce landfill waste.

Encourage community participation in sustainable waste management.

✨ Features

🔑 User Authentication – Secure login & registration for households and composters.

📝 Contribution Management – Users can log the amount of organic waste contributed (in kg).

👨‍🌾 Composter Dashboard – Composters can view contributions, track collection status, and update records.

📊 Reports & Tracking – Helps monitor total waste collected and processed.

🌍 Community Impact – Supports waste-to-resource conversion and promotes sustainability.

🛡️ Admin Login – Admin can manage composters and contributions.
